# What-is-robotic-surgery-and-how-is-it-used-in-cancer-treatment-

Robotic surgery is a type of advanced surgery where doctors use robotic tools to do operations with more precision. A machine with robotic arms helps the surgeon make very small cuts and movements. The doctor still controls everything, but with better vision and accuracy. In cancer surgery, robotic systems help remove tumors while saving healthy tissues. It's mostly used in cancers like prostate, kidney, uterus, and colon. Because the cuts are small, recovery is usually faster and there is less pain after surgery. Not every patient needs robotic surgery, it depends on type and stage of cancer. But when used correctly, it can give good outcomes with low risk. This method needs trained surgeons who understand both cancer and robotic systems.
